  "imprintContent": "Far back, behind the mountains of words, far from the countries of vowels and consonants, live the blind texts. They live in seclusion in Buchstabhausen on the coast of the Semantik, a large linguistic ocean. A small stream called Duden flows through their village and supplies them with the necessary Regelialien. It's a paradisiacal land where fried sentence fragments fly into your mouth. Not even the almighty punctuation rules the blind texts - an almost unorthographic life. One day, however, a small line of dummy text, her name was Lorem Ipsum, decided to go out into the wide world of grammar. The great Oxmox advised her against it, as it was teeming with nasty commas, wild question marks and sneaky semicolons, but the little blind text was undeterred. It grabbed its seven capitals, slipped its initial into its belt and set off. As it climbed the first hills of the Italic Mountains, it took one last look back at the skyline of its home town of Buchstabhausen, the headline of Alphabetdorf and the subline of its own street, Zeilengasse. A wistful question ran down its cheek, then it continued on its way. On the way, it met a copy. The copy warned the blind text that it had been rewritten many times where it came from and that all that was left of its origin was the word \"and\" and that the blind text should turn around and return to its own safe country."
